Summary:
Teucrium is a traffic-grapher.
Its focus is on performance, flexibility, features, ability to consider
details of individual packets for counting purposes and accuracy. To
effectively achieve these goals, cross-platform compatiblity has been
sacrificed; teucrium currently only works on Linux.

Hard Dependencies:
* A reasonably modern Linux
* Python (>=2.4, <3.0)
* python-ctypes
* gonium
* rrdtool
* python-rrdtool

Suggested kernel features:
* binfmt_misc

Suggested utilities:
* setcap

Design Overview:
Copying individual packets to userspace to count them there is both
inefficient, and, in many cases, inaccurate under sufficient load.

Fortunately, Linux's netfilter subsystem can be used to count traffic in
kernelspace; in addition, netfilter offers many powerful options for filtering
packets, which can be used to provide seperate counters for different types of
packets.
Spawning an {ip,ip6}tables instance for each read of xtables counters would
be relatively inefficient, and also highly inelegant. Instead, teucrium uses
the gonium.linux.xtables netfilter-interface for counter reading. This has the
added benefit on allowing gonium to function with just the CAP_NET_ADMIN posix
capability; {ip,ip6}tables (through their use of raw sockets) additionally
require CAP_NET_RAW.
Note that an iptables binary is still required for initially setting up the
counting rules, since the gonium.linux.xtables interface doesn't have
write-support for xtables rules (and likely never will).
