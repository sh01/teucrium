Scripts for building pyeggs and debian packages are provided. However, there's
some things that aren't taken care of by installing one of those packages:

To execute /usr/sbin/teucrium you will need to have a binfmt-supporting kernel,
and to configure binfmt_misc to execute python-bytecode-containing files
bypassing them to the approriate python interpreter.
If your distribution doesn't take care of this for you (newer debian versions
do), the commands to do it by hand for python versions 2.4 and 2.5 are:

# echo ':python2.4:M::\x6d\xf2\x0d\x0a::/usr/bin/python2.4:C' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
# echo ':python2.5:M::\xb3\xf2\x0d\x0a::/usr/bin/python2.5:C' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

In addition, teucrium's daemon mode requires CAP_NET_ADMIN. You could just run
it as root, but this is not recommended. Instead, you should use the 'setcap'
tool to set the permission on teucrium's binary:
# setcap CAP_NET_ADMIN=ep /usr/sbin/teucrium

Of course, if you do make it setcap, you should make sure not to also make it
world-executable.

If, despite the above warning you insist on running teucrium as root, there's
no particular reason to make use of binfmt_misc to execute it, and you can
also just call it as:
# python /usr/sbin/teucrium <args>
